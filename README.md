# Alzheimer's Disease in Mus Musculus - RNA-seq Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of RNA-seq data related to Alzheimer's disease in Mus Musculus (mice). The data has been sourced from Refine.Bio and will be used to investigate specific scientific questions related to gene expression differences in Alzheimer's disease.

## Dataset Information
The dataset includes RNA-seq data for Mus Musculus samples, focusing on Alzheimer's disease. The dataset contains at least 50 samples, ensuring robust analysis.

### Data Source
- **Platform:** Refine.Bio
- **Organism:** Mus Musculus (mouse)
- **Technology:** RNA-seq

## Scientific Question
The main objective of this project is to investigate gene expression differences between Alzheimer's disease samples and healthy control samples in Mus Musculus. Specific questions include:
- What are the key gene expression differences between Alzheimer's disease and healthy samples?
- Can we identify specific biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease in mice?
